# Previous documentation

You can find the documentation for the previous version of Formity in this GitHub repository. The package was originally published as `formity` but has since been renamed to `@formity/react`.

If you still wish to use the old version, youâ€™ll need to install the `formity` package. However, please note that this version is fully deprecated, and we strongly recommend switching to the latest package.
